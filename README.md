# Get merged bed and concatenateed
# Get Fasta 
# ran mapping to truncate headers and but be able to map back at the end
# run MAFFT on bash (computer not slurm doesnt work for some reason)
# trimming using trimal 
# seqmagick convert fasta to .phy file 
# phyml to get phy file (text files were empty)
# So decided to do FastTree -nt trimmed_dmr_hervh_aligned.phy > tree.nwk
# view tree.py to map back names and visualize
